# C---Text-Pattern-Matching
This was the first assignment in CS 280 class at NJIT.

This program demonstrated my ability to program in C++ and Java.

The problem this project solved was it would find a pattern a text file, and print the number of context lines preceding and immediately following the line with the match.

The rules for pattern:

Characters in the pattern must exactly match characters in the input line. In addition the following rules will

apply in a pattern:

• The character . (a dot) in the pattern matches any character in the input line

• The character sequence . (backslash dot) in the pattern matches a dot character in the input line

When your program detects a match between the pattern in the input line, it should perform these steps:

Print the “context” lines immediately preceding the line with the match

Print the line with the match

Print the “context” lines immediately following the line with the match
